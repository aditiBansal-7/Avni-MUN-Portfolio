      <p>
        I am a confident, diplomatically inclined individual with a strong interest in international relations and structured dialogue.
        Since starting my MUN journey in 2023, Iâ€™ve served as both a delegate and an Executive Board member at national and international conferences.
        These experiences have strengthened my grasp of committee dynamics, Rules of Procedure, and the value of inclusive, balanced debate.
